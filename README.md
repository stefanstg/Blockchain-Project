# Time Locked Wallet

#### Short description
 The idea behind time-locked wallets is to lock the funds for a set period of time. The amount locked in the wallet can only be withdrawn when the set date is passed and only by the authorized person/beneficiary.
     
#### Technologies
      Etherium, Node.js, Truffle Framework, Solidity, Web3.js
 
#### Security policies

#### Attacks on crypto wallets are based on:
•	stealing the locally stored passphrase or private key ⇒ prevention with data at rest encryption
•	overlay attack ⇒ restrict screen sharing
•	MITM attack ⇒ data in transit should be protected with AES-256 encryption, and secure socket layer (SSL) / transport layer security (TLS) must be strictly enforced for all communications.
•	wallet theft ⇒ enforce smart risk control withdraw system & 2FA authentication
